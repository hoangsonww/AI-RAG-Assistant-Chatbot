abstract: >
  Lumina is a full-stack, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered AI chatbot 
  assistant designed by Son (David) Nguyen. It provides intelligent, accurate, and 
  responsive answers about the creator or general topics. Built with Node.js, Express, 
  React, TypeScript, MongoDB, LangChain, Pinecone, and multiple AI APIs, the system 
  offers a modern, responsive, and animated interface with authentication, conversation 
  history, and deployment on Vercel/Netlify. The project demonstrates how to integrate 
  advanced AI/ML techniques with practical web technologies to deliver a personal, 
  production-ready assistant.
