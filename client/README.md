## Overview

The Lumina frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript** and styled using **Material‑UI (MUI)**. It provides a dynamic, modern user interface featuring:

- A responsive design adaptable to all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and theme toggling (dark/light mode)
- A collapsible sidebar for easy access to conversation history
- Dedicated pages for login, signup, and password reset

The frontend seamlessly integrates with the backend to provide functionalities such as user authentication, conversation management, and AI chat interactions.

## Key Features

- **AI Chat Interface:** Interact with an intelligent assistant that answers questions about David Nguyen and various topics.
- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and manage your account with JWT-based authentication.
- **Passkey (WebAuthn) Sign-in:** Passwordless login with Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello, or a phone via QR. Supports discoverable (usernameless) credentials, an optional post-signup enrollment prompt, and a `/passkeys` management page for adding, naming, and revoking credentials. Email + password remains as a fallback.
- **Toast Notifications:** Global `ToastProvider` surfaces success and error messages from auth/passkey flows instead of relying on `alert()`.
- **Conversation History:** Save, retrieve, rename, and search your past interactions (available for authenticated users).
- **Auto-Generated Titles:** AI automatically generates concise titles for conversations based on the first message.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between dark and light modes, with your preference stored locally.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a fully optimized experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite** – lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **React** with **TypeScript** – for building the user interface
- **Material‑UI (MUI)** – for modern, responsive UI components
- **React Router** – for seamless navigation between pages
- **Axios** – for API communication with the backend
- **@simplewebauthn/browser** – browser-side WebAuthn helpers (`startRegistration`, `startAuthentication`) for passkey flows
- **React Markdown** – for rendering AI-generated markdown content

---

## User Interface

The client application features several distinct pages and components:

- **Landing Page:** Showcases the app’s features with animations and call-to-action buttons.
- **Homepage:** The central hub for chatting with the AI, featuring a collapsible sidebar for conversation history.
- **Authentication Pages:** Includes login, signup, and password reset pages. The login page exposes a "Sign in with passkey" action when WebAuthn is available; signup offers a one-time enrollment dialog after account creation.
- **Passkeys Page (`/passkeys`):** Authenticated route for adding, naming, and revoking passkeys. Reachable via the fingerprint icon in the navbar.
- **Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between dark and light modes using the navigation bar.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a consistent experience across all devices.
